  - name: step1
    description: >
      Describe the first step in detail. If any tool is used, mention the tool
      name and parameters. If more context is needed for the code to be
      reviewed, like caller or callee or function references, mention the tool
      to be used to get that context as given in tools schema YAML. Example below.
    tools:
      - name: ast_mcp_tools
        function: get_function_context_for_project_mcp
        parameters:
          github_repo: https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate
          function_name: example_function
  - name: step2
    description: >
      Second step description. If no tool is used, just describe the step.
      Continue for all steps needed for the code review.
