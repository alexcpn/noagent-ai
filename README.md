# No Agent Framework

This is a library for performing LLM-based automation without using complex frameworks.

Just plain MCP and API calls combined with good old-fashioned programming.

There are example projects like [Code Reviewer](code_reviewer), which is built on a [Code Review MCP Server](code_reviewer/code_review_mcp_server). This server contains the business logic for AST parsing and querying the code for function definitions and their call locations.

This setup can be used by an AI agent to generate sufficient context to properly review the code.

Enjoy!
